PUBLIC_INTERFACE
Top-level package initializer for the BackendAPI source tree.

This file intentionally exists to ensure that `src` is recognized as a normal
Python package across different environments and tooling, so imports like
`from src.api.main import app` resolve reliably.

Note: Keep package-level side effects to a minimum.
